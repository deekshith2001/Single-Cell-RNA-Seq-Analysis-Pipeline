- Grade: 8.3 + 4.15 from Bonus. 
- Feedback: Great job overall. In Task 1, it's important to include plots showcasing your UMAP and t-SNE trials, but your explanations are great (100%). The implementation of trustworthiness in task 2 is a nice touch and the task is completed thoroughly (100%). Finally, some mistakes exist only in task 3 where no joint probability plots and no visualizations of the Gaussians were created. (50%). Regarding the Bonus task, density-based clustering is a unique approach, however, no synthetic data were generated via the GMM model (50%). Your ARI score of your predictions with the true labels is 0.58.
